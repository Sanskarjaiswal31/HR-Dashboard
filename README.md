# HR Attrition Dashboard ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project involves creating an interactive HR Attrition Dashboard using Tableau, with the visual interface designed in Figma. The data used is Real World Fake Data (RWFD) to simulate scenarios in employee attrition, covering aspects such as demographics, survey scores, and trends over time.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Wrangling**: 
    - **Data Acquisition**: Imported HR data in its raw format.
    - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized the data using MS Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Developed new metrics and aggregated fields (e.g., attrition rate, satisfaction levels) to provide deeper insights into the data.
    - Used SQL scripts to perform data aggregation and create calculated fields for more dynamic analysis in Tableau.

3. **Interactive Data Visualization**:
    - Built an interactive Tableau dashboard that showcases key metrics such as overall attrition, top job roles affected, and demographic breakdowns.
    - Added parameter controls to enable dynamic filtering and toggling between different time periods (Year, Quarter, Month, Week).

4. **Dashboard UI Design**:
    - Created a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design for the dashboard using Figma, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation for end-users.

## Key Dashboard Features
- **Overview**: Quick stats on total attrition, current employees, and attrition rate.
- **Top Job Roles**: Displays job roles most affected by attrition.
- **Attrition Trend**: Offers interactive trend analysis with options to view data by different time frames.
- **Demographics**: Visual representation of employee distribution by age, gender, and education.
- **Survey Score**: Highlights key metrics like job satisfaction, involvement, and work-life balance.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Tableau
- **Data Wrangling**: SQL for preprocessing and feature engineering
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau for building an interactive dashboard
- **Design**: Figma for dashboard layout and design
- **Languages**: SQL for data manipulation and calculations
